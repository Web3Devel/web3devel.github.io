X3D Model Examples Archives

Multiple X3D Model Examples Archives are available that provide numerous scenes
illustrating a broad variety of capabilities for Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics.

The X3D Model Examples Archives demonstrate how X3D nodes and scenes work. Thousands
of scenes are provided in all X3D encodings. You can browse them individually
online or download fully complete, separately installable .zip archives. 

Archive support includes X3D-Edit authoring tool, X3D Tooltips, X3D Validator,
complete course slidesets and videos, plus this open-source model archive.
Source changes are maintained in version control and bug tracking is online.
