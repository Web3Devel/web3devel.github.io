NavigationInfo { type [ "EXAMINE" "ANY" ] } ###  Default X3D NavigationInfo

Background {
  groundColor [ 0 0 0 ]
  skyAngle [ 1.309 1.571 ]
  skyColor [ 0 0.2 0.7 0 0.5 1 1 1 1 ]
}
# Note that navigation mode doesn't matter much here, since you cannot approach the backround, it always stays at maximum (horizon) distance
# At least EXAMINE mode lets you easily look up/down/around.
