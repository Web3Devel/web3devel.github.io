# META "description" "Dungeon wall #2: this is a simple rectangular floor textured with a stone block image. An ElevationGrid node is used so that the floor is made up of multiple polygons, each subject to individual lighting calculations. This insures that when a PointLight is placed near the all, the area beside the light is bright, while the areas at the corners are not."
