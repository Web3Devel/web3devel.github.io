# [Scene] ========== ========== ==========

# Seven slabs are created, each using a Box node. Each slab is shaded a different material:
# Slab Diffuse Emissive Transparency; 1. White white black 0.0; 2. Red black red 0.0; 3. Green green black 0.5; 4. Blue blue white 0.25; 5. Yellow yellow black 0.5; 6. Cyan cyan black 0.0; 7. Magenta red magenta 0.0
# Some PC browsers may not support transparency. Others may not support shading using both diffuse and emissive colors. So, your results may vary.
# Things to experiment with:
# Try different transparency levels.
# Turn off the headlight on your VRML browser and observe which slabs glow.
