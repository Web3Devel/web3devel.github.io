# [Scene] ========== ========== ==========

# This world illustrates how far you can go using the primitive geometry nodes: Box, Cone, and Cylinder. An entire fairy-tale castle is built by translating and rotating these shapes into position.
# Things to experiment with...
# Change the color scheme to make the castle an evil lair.
# Add texture maps to make the castle walls look like they are built from stone.
# Make the castle door an anchor. Clicking on the door leads to another world describing the castle interior.
# Add panorama cloud and mountain textures to the Background node.
# In Nintendo 64 style, add platforms that rise and fall and cannons that rise up when you approach. You can build these using PositionInterpolators and TimeSensors to run the animations, and ProximitySensors to trigger the actions.
