# META "description" "Squishy ball world illustrates the use of orientation, color, and position interpolators. The world contains left, center, and right balls. The left and right balls swing back and forth, pivoting about a common point above the center ball. Each time the left and right balls swing inward, striking the center ball, the center ball squishes and turns red."

# [Scene] ========== ========== ==========

# To make this effect, two orientation interpolators swing the left and right balls back and forth. A position interpolator's output is used as a scale value to squish the center ball. Finally, a color interpolator repeatedly turns the center ball red, then blue.
